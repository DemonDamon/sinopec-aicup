**Summary**: This paper introduces a hybrid PIML approach for production forecasting that ensures predictions adhere to material balance constraints, thus avoiding unphysical solutions. It leverages the Capacitance Resistance Model (CRM) to incorporate physical laws.

**Summary**: This comprehensive review focuses on the application of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) in fluid mechanics, highlighting its emergence as a powerful tool that integrates data-driven approaches with fundamental physical laws. The paper largely focuses on physics-informed supervised and deep learning techniques. It outlines how PIML leverages the strengths of machine learning (e.g., handling complex data patterns) while addressing its weaknesses (e.g., unphysical solutions) by embedding governing partial differential equations (PDEs) as soft constraints or components within the neural network architecture. This integration enables more accurate and physically consistent predictions in complex fluid dynamics problems. The paper emphasizes the potential for PIML to advance modeling, simulation, and optimization in fields relying heavily on fluid mechanics.

**Summary**: This research demonstrates how Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) enhances permeability prediction in heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs. It integrates physics-based constraints into machine learning models to improve predictive accuracy and robustness, addressing limitations of traditional empirical and conventional ML techniques. The study develops three tree-ensemble algorithms—XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest—for permeability prediction using well-log data. A key innovation is the use of a discrepancy model to predict residuals between core and NMR permeability. Results show significant performance improvement with PIML, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.908; RMSE = 16.73 mD). The PIML approach is confirmed to bridge the gap between data-driven predictions and fundamental reservoir physics, offering a more reliable and generalizable permeability estimation framework.

**Summary**: This paper proposes an automated data-driven pressure transient analysis for water-drive gas reservoirs, coupling machine learning with the Ensemble Kalman Filter. A key finding is the extraction of "slopes from the pressure derivative curve as features" to predict pressure transient dynamics and identify water invasion modes. This directly addresses using simplified physical concepts (pressure response in well tests) as features for ML models, aiding in understanding the reservoir’s response to water influx.

**Summary**: This paper proposes a general framework based on "balance equations" to construct residual loss terms in Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML), ensuring physical consistency. It argues that all fundamental classical physics equations can be derived from a generic balance equation combined with specific constitutive relations. The framework supports both soft (loss function penalties) and hard (model architecture encoding) enforcement of physical laws. It emphasizes incorporating fundamental conservation laws (mass, momentum, energy) and constitutive relations (like Darcy's Law for fluid mechanics in porous media) as soft constraints in neural networks. This unified approach facilitates PIML development across domains and provides a systematic way to enforce physical integrity in ML solutions.
