- **URL:** https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/seg/geophysics/article/86/5/IM85/607578/Lithology-identification-from-well-log-curves-via
  - **Key Details:** This research addresses lithology identification from well-log curves using neural networks. Critically, the abstract states: "We split the data into a training data set and a validation data set *by well*, and we use cross validation to train the neural networks." This directly supports the need for group-based cross-validation. It also emphasizes incorporating stratigraphic sequence information and considering the influence of neighboring formations due to the sequential nature of the data. The study uses a publicly available dataset from the North Sea and applies RNN-based and 1D CNN-based networks.

### Focused Research Iteration - Spatial/Temporal Cross-Validation and Data Leakage

- **URL:** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706125000618
  - **Key Details:** This article on 3-dimensional digital soil mapping extensively discusses **data leakage** in spatially correlated datasets, which is highly analogous to well log data. It rigorously compares **Leave-Sample-Out Cross-Validation (LSOCV)** and **Leave-Profile-Out Cross-Validation (LPOCV)**. LPOCV is highlighted as crucial for preventing data leakage and inflated accuracy when data points from the same spatial unit (like a 'profile' or, in our case, a 'well') are highly autocorrelated (e.g., vertical autocorrelation). LSOCV can lead to overoptimistic accuracy metrics if samples from the same profile appear in both training and test sets. LPOCV ensures that all samples from a given profile are either entirely in the training set or the test set, thus eliminating within-profile leakage.

- **URL:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395870693_Geological_information-driven_deep_learning_for_lithology_identification_from_well_logs
  - **Key Details:** This research emphasizes that many deep learning approaches for well log lithology identification treat well logs as generic 1D time series, neglecting multi-scale geological information. Their proposed geology-driven framework transforms 1D well logs into 2D multi-scale feature maps, explicitly representing geological features. Crucially, regarding cross-validation, the paper states: "To prevent information leakage after applying wavelet transform, we divided the dataset into **8 training wells and 2 test wells**, ensuring that the wells used for training and testing are independent." This directly demonstrates a **group-based hold-out strategy (Leave-Two-Groups-Out)** by well, confirming its practical application to prevent data leakage between wells. The study's method aims for enhanced generalization across wells with differing lithological distributions.

- **URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11659326/
  - **Key Details:** This article addresses challenges in data-driven geospatial modeling. While focused on agriculture, its discussion on cross-validation for data with **temporal, spatial, hierarchical, or phylogenetic structure** is directly relevant. It emphasizes that standard K-Fold CV can lead to overoptimistic performance estimates if not adapted for such data structures, due to dependencies (e.g., spatial autocorrelation). The paper cites prior work (Ecography 2017) highlighting the need for specialized CV methods in these contexts. This reinforces the principle that domain-specific correlations (like those within a well or between closely spaced depths) must be respected during splitting to avoid data leakage.

- **URL:** https://medium.com/@soumyachess1496/cross-validation-in-time-series-566ae4981ce4
  - **Key Details:** This article provides an overview of cross-validation for time series data. It explains why standard K-Fold is problematic due to **data leakage** (future data influencing training) and proposes alternatives.
    - **Rolling Basis Cross-Validation (Walk-Forward Validation):** This method involves creating sequential train-test splits where the training set always precedes the test set temporally. The model is trained on an initial segment, evaluated on the next, then the training window expands, and the process repeats. This is a robust method for strictly preserving temporal order and preventing future data leakage. It's highly relevant given well logs are depth-sequential data. [[ref]](https://medium.com/@soumyachess1496/cross-validation-in-time-series-566ae4981ce4)
    - **Blocked Cross-Validation:** A variant where data is split into contiguous blocks, and entire blocks are moved between train and test sets. This prevents splitting highly correlated adjacent observations (like adjacent depth points in a well) across folds, reducing within-block leakage. [[ref]](https://medium.com/@soumyachess1496/cross-validation-in-time-series-566ae4981ce4)
    
**Summary of new findings to answer the question:**

Specific cross-validation strategies, *other than* simple group-based methods, that leverage the depth/spatial continuity of well log data to prevent data leakage include:

*   **Leave-Profile-Out Cross-Validation (LPOCV):** This is essentially equivalent to `GroupKFold` or `LeaveOneGroupOut` when each 'profile' corresponds to a 'WELL'. It's explicitly designed for spatial data with strong autocorrelation, ensuring all samples from a given spatial unit (well) are kept together in either the train or test set. This directly addresses the data leakage risk from samples within the same well appearing in different splits. [[ref]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706125000618)
*   **Rolling Basis Cross-Validation (Walk-Forward Validation):** Given that well log data is sequential with depth, this time series CV method is relevant. It prevents leakage by ensuring that only 'past' (shallower) data is used to train models that predict 'future' (deeper) data within a well. This can be used in conjunction with grouping by well (e.g., applying rolling basis CV *within* each training well in a GroupKFold setup, or training on shallower wells and testing on deeper sections of other wells if there's a geological depth relationship across wells that mimics a time series). [[ref]](https://medium.com/@soumyachess1496/cross-validation-in-time-series-566ae4981ce4)
*   **Blocked Cross-Validation:** Similar to rolling basis, this recognizes local correlations within contiguous segments (depth intervals) of well logs. It prevents splitting a single correlated segment across train/test folds, reducing localized leakage. [[ref]](https://medium.com/@soumyachess1496/cross-validation-in_time-series-566ae4981ce4)

**Comparison with GroupKFold:**

*   `GroupKFold` (or LPOCV/LeaveOneGroupOut) is the **most fundamental and critical strategy** for well log data. It directly addresses the primary source of data leakage: identical or highly correlated samples from the same well contaminating both training and validation sets. Without it, models will likely overestimate their generalization capability due to knowledge of specific well characteristics. [[ref]](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html), [[ref]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706125000618)
*   **Rolling Basis/Blocked Cross-Validation** are complementary, especially if predictions involve depth extrapolation or if the sequence within a well also needs to be rigorously evaluated against future (deeper) observations. These are depth-aware strategies but are typically applied *within* a larger group (well) or when wells themselves have a strong temporal/depth ordering relative to each other for evaluation purposes. They are more specific ways to manage the sequential nature *after* ensuring the group (well) separation. [[ref]](https://medium.com/@soumyachess1496/cross-validation-in-time-series-566ae4981ce4)

The research strongly confirms that **GroupKFold (or equivalent group-based hold-out)** is paramount. Strategies like Rolling Basis CV offer additional robustness if there's a strong predictive temporal/depth component *within* wells or if the dataset structure allows for simulating predictions into unknown depth sections. Depth-based stratified *sampling* might be used for class balance, but the splitting strategies preventing leakage for continuous depth data primarily fall under group-based or time-series (sequential) methods.
